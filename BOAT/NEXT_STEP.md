# BOAT Next Step

## Current task: read-only adapter for saved TrendForge artifacts

Risk: low. Provider cost: none. Production behavior change: none.

### Verified baseline before adapter
- Draft PR #35: https://github.com/TrendforgeHQ/Trendforgehq.github.io/pull/35
- Previous branch-head offline suite: [run 38112892985](https://github.com/TrendforgeHQ/Trendforgehq.github.io/actions/runs/38112892985), **39 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped**.
- Factual repair proposals remain proposal-only, require human approval, and never apply changes.

### Actual artifact inspection
Inspected the archived claim-blocked attempt:
`data/article-attempts/20261010-205638-anthropic-ai-model-submits-false-murder-tip-to-philadelphia-police-claim-blocked/`
- `article.md` is the saved article text.
- `claim-verification.json` contains `claims[]`, `sources[]`, claim `sourceId`, `bestUrl`, `sourceRole`, `bestPassageId`, and `provenanceFactMatches[]`.
- `metadata.json` records `workflowRun` and `workflowSha`, but does **not** record article/report/evidence-pack SHA-256 hashes.
- The archived attempt directory does **not** contain a canonical evidence-pack JSON file.
- Legacy `bestPassageId` uses values such as `S1-FF1,S2-FF6`, unlike the proposal engine's canonical `S1-P1` passage IDs. The adapter must preserve these values, not rewrite them or infer a passage match.
- Therefore this archived attempt cannot prove same-run article/report/evidence-pack lineage. Its adapter result must remain `unknown`; this is expected fail-closed behavior, not a test failure.

### Implemented in this step
- Added `scripts/boat-artifact-adapter.mjs` as a read-only adapter for saved article, claim-report, evidence-pack, and metadata bytes.
- It preserves existing claim fields and legacy passage IDs without invented conversions.
- It trusts only hashes recorded in metadata; it does not manufacture hashes and claim that they establish same-run provenance.
- Missing canonical evidence pack or recorded hashes emits explicit adapter findings and forces proposal status to `unknown`.
- CLI writes a separate output, refuses to overwrite inputs or an existing output, and does not modify the article.
- Added `scripts/test-boat-artifact-adapter.mjs` for compatible artifact mapping, legacy passage preservation, missing-lineage fail-closed behavior, malformed JSON, and proposal schema-contract assertions.
- The existing offline workflow's `scripts/test-boat-*.mjs` glob includes the new tests without requiring a production workflow change.

### Validation
- Adapter + schema-contract check [run 38114116567](https://github.com/TrendforgeHQ/Trendforgehq.github.io/actions/runs/38114116567): **44 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped**.
- Real archived-attempt CLI integration [run 38114233407](https://github.com/TrendforgeHQ/Trendforgehq.github.io/actions/runs/38114233407): **45 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped**. The test confirms `unknown` status when the evidence pack and recorded hashes are absent, and verifies the original article/report/metadata bytes are unchanged.
- No provider, external-source fetch, image generation, site build, or publishing workflow was run.
- No claim is made that the archived historical attempt has valid same-run evidence lineage.

### Next action after green tests
1. All three archived blocked attempts have now been inspected: each stores `article.md`, `article-brief.json`, `claim-verification.json`, and `metadata.json`, but no canonical evidence-pack JSON or recorded artifact SHA-256 hashes. Their legacy passage labels vary (`S1-FF1`, `S2-BODY`, `S1-BODY`), so do not map them into `Sx-Pn` by guesswork.
2. Next, inspect the live producer/consumer code for the authoritative evidence-pack schema and determine whether an exact same-run pack can be recovered from existing committed artifacts or workflow artifacts. If it cannot, retain `unknown` and document the retention gap; do not reconstruct historical provenance from briefs.
3. Keep the PR draft/unmerged. Any future accepted factual correction must go through the existing claim verifier and all required editorial, image-safety, and build gates.

### Guardrails
- Do not change `main`; do not merge PR #35 automatically.
- No paid providers or publishing runs.
- No article edits or automatic repair application.
- Existing evidence, claim-verification, editorial, image-safety, and build gates remain authoritative.
